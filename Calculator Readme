# Fun Calculator 🎉

Welcome to the **Fun Calculator**! This simple Python script performs basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) on two user-provided numbers with a touch of fun and humor. 😎

## Features ✨
- **Addition** ➕
- **Subtraction** ➖
- **Multiplication** ✖️
- **Division** ➗
- **Decimal Support** – Works with both whole numbers and decimals.
- **User-Friendly** – Simple prompts and clear output.

## How to Use 🚀
1. Run the script in a Python environment (Python 3.x recommended).
2. Enter the first number when prompted.
3. Enter the second number when prompted.
4. The calculator will display the results of all four operations.

### Example:
```bash
Enter the first number: 10
Enter the second number: 2
Results of your two numbers:
Sum: 12.0
Difference: 8.0
Product: 20.0
Quotient: 5.0
```

## Notes ⚠️
- The script does **not** handle division by zero. If you enter `0` as the second number, it will raise an error. Be careful! 😅
- The script uses `float()` to accept decimal inputs. If you want only integers, you can modify the code to use `int()` instead.

## Future Improvements 🔮
- Add error handling for division by zero.
- Include more operations like exponentiation or modulus.
- Add a loop to allow continuous calculations until the user exits.
